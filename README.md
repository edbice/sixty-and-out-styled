Don't you hate handing over your life event and friend data to party invite softwares? I do. 
This is a project to vibe code an invite to my retirement as a nonprofit tech leader for 20 years. 

The styleguide for the project has evolved, but, having had a working relationship with Douglas Engelbart I sought a throw-back terminal style experience. The backend is google sheets for simplicity. 

Simple, retro party invite software.
